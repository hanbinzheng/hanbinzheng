# About Me
- 🔭 I’m zhb, a freshman at ZJUI. I major in ECE, but know little about this field.

- 🌱 I hope to record my learning process while pushing myself to work hard.

  I don't know what I'm interested in. I am just haunting, without aim.

- 💬 Ask me anything you want.

  My personal email address is ```hanbinzheng54@gmail.com```, but I seldom check it.

  So, if you want to contact with me, ```hanbin.24@intl.zju.edu.cn``` or ```hanbinz2@illinois.edu``` is better.
