# About Me
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m zhb, a freshman at ZJUI. I major in ECE but noly know a little about this field.

- ğŸŒ± I hope to record my learning process while pushing myself to work hard.

  I don't know what I take interest in. I am just haunting, without aim.

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want.

  My personal email address is ```hanbinzheng54@gmail.com```, but I seldom check it.

  So, if you want to contact with me, ```hanbin.24@intl.zju.edu.cn``` ot ```hanbinz2@illinois.edu``` is better.
